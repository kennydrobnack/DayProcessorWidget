*Overview*

DayProcessorWidget is a DashBoard widget for MacOS/X that shows how much of the day has been processed by your computer.

*Installation*

To install, simply download the DayProcessorWidget.zip file somewhere on your computer, unzip, and double-click. This will open it in DashBoard and it will prompt if you want to keep it or not. Of course you want to keep it!

*About the DayProcessorWidget*

The idea was inspired by a Yahoo Widget available at:

http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/ultimate-day-processor

Unlike Ultimate Day Processor, DayProcessorWidget does not have a built-in CPU meter.

It was built using DashCode and still has remnants of the built-in countdown Widget template.

*Why?*

Seeing how little of the day is remaining and how fast it is flying by seemed like a great anti-procrastination tool. Give it a try!
