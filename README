This is a DashBoard widget for MacOS/X that shows how much of the day has been processed by your computer.

The idea was inspired by a Yahoo Widget available at:

http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/ultimate-day-processor

Unlike Ultimate Day Processor, DayProcessorWidget does not have a built-in CPU meter.

It was built using DashCode and still has remnants of the built-in countdown Widget template.
